# Password-Generator

In this assignment, we were given the code for the HTML and CSS, and were required to give the user options in making a password. I added the options into their own arrays, and given the user options, and the use of "if" statements, added these individual arrays, into a joined array. This joined array contains all avaialable characters, that can be used for the password. I then used a for loop, to randomly select characters, and create a password using those randomly selected characters. The user, will then receive their password, when they press the button, labeled "generate password" on the screen.
